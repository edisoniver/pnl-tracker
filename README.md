#A PNL Tracker for Binance Spot Wallet


**Plan of Attack** 

- [] Use CCXT Library - Use their library to communicate with binance api.
- [] Implement SQLite database for tracking spot transactions. 
- [] Basic PNL calculation. 
- [] Async / AJAX for real time updates for PNL, crypto prices and tickers.
- [] Create a Flask web app for a GUI.


**Optional** 

- Create a login system that allow users to place their spot entries without the need of their binance API token.
